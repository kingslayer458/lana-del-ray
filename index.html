            Not even they can stop me now
            Boy, I be flying overhead
            Their heavy words can't bring me down
            Boy, I've been raised from the dead

            No one even knows how hard life was
            I don't even think about it now because
            I've finally found you (oh, sing it to me)

            Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
            Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
            Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
            (How do you like me now?)
            Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
            'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
            Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
            (How do you like me now?)

            'Merican dreams came true somehow
            I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
            I heard the streets were paved with gold
            That's what my father said

            No one even knows what life was like
            Now I'm in L.A. and it's paradise
            I've finally found you (oh, sing it to me)

            Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
            Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
            Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
            (How do you like me now?)
            Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
            'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
            Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
            (How do you like me now?)

            Sweet like cinnamon
